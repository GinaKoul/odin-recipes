    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Cake</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>10 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup coconut oil, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Truffle topping</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Garnish</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>whipped cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Cake</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Step:</strong> Preheat oven to 325˚F. Spray an 8-inch round or square cake pan with baking spray or grease the pan with butter and then dust with flour. Line the bottom of the pan with a round (or square) piece of parchment paper. Don't omit this or the cake will be difficult to remove from the pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Second Step:</strong> Place butter in a medium-size microwave-safe bowl and cover bowl with a plate or paper towel. Cook in the microwave on high power for 1 ½ minutes, or until butter is melted.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Third Step:</strong> Add sugar to the bowl with melted butter and whisk to combine. Add eggs, one at a time and stir well after each addition. Add the cocoa, flour, vanilla and salt. Stir just until all dry ingredients are incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Fourth Step:</strong>Transfer batter to prepared pan and spread out to an even layer. Bake for 20-22 minutes. Don’t over bake. The cake should be slightly firm on the outside, but moist and sticky inside.</li>
        <li><strong>Fifth Step:</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Truffle topping</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Step:</strong>While the cake is baking, wash out the bowl. After the cake comes out of the oven, heat the heavy cream in the clean bowl for 1 minute on high power. Add chocolate chips and vanilla. Stir and allow to sit for 1 minute. Then stir until all chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Step:</strong>Pour truffle mixture over the semi-cooled cake and spread to an even layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Step:</strong>Allow the truffle topping on the cake to cool for 10 minutes (otherwise, the salt will “melt” into the topping”), then sprinkle with about ¼ teaspoon flaky sea salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Fourth Step:</strong>Cool the cake at room temperature for several hours, then refrigerate for 30 minutes before removing it from the pan. </li>
        <li><strong>Fifth Step:</strong>To remove, run a thin-bladed knife around the outer edges of the cake. Invert pan onto a dinner plate and, holding the plate and pan together, give it a good shake downwards. If the cake doesn’t release, go around the edges again with a knife then repeat with inverting cake. Once the cake is released, invert again so that the truffle layer is on the top.</li>
        <li><strong>Sixth Step:</strong>Serve with a dollop of whipped cream.</li> 
    </ol>
